### The Magic Glasses
Violet had always worn glasses, for as long as she could remember. Being ten years old, it was possible she’d been wearing them for ten years. Maybe she was born with glasses!

Violet couldn’t see things that were far away from her, but she also had trouble reading. Her eyesight was very poor.

Sometimes, while she was doing her homework in study hall, her glasses would slide down to the tip of her nose. Once, they even fell off her face and landed on the floor.

“Violet, what’s going on?” her teacher, Mrs. Shellsworth, asked when she saw Violet crawling on the floor once with her hands stretched out.

“I can’t find my glasses,” replied Violet, shyly. The rest of the students looked up from their books and started to laugh.

When Violet found the brown specs behind her desk, she quickly put them back onto her face. But they wouldn’t stay on; they were broken.

Not wanting to draw any more attention to herself, Violet held her glasses onto her face with her index finger and pretended to read.

That night, she told her mother what had happened.

“We’re going to have to get you new glasses,” she said, sternly. Violet’s mother was a doctor, and she worked long hours. When she came home, she was often too tired to do much of anything other than watch television with Violet. Her father didn’t live with her. He’d moved out of the house when Violet was just a little girl. She visited her father on weekends, though. He lived in a nearby town and always took her to baseball games in the summer.

But it wasn’t summer yet. Violet still had three months left of school, and that meant three more months of being made fun of because of her silly loose glasses.

Violet hated her glasses.

The day after her glasses had fallen to the floor, Violet’s mother took her to the eye doctor. They did all sorts of tests to see whether she needed a new prescription. After the tests, which showed that her eyes had gotten worse since the last time she’d been there, it was time to pick out new glasses frames.

Violet looked at the shiny glass case that was almost as tall as she was. There were boring brown frames and simple black frames. But there were also some pink and blue frames, and even some sparkly yellow frames.

“Mom, can I get those?” Violet said, pointing to the sparkly yellow frames.

“No, you cannot. Those glasses are not appropriate for school,” said her mother tersely.

“But…” said Violet.

“No ‘buts.’ You will get these frames right here,” said her mother, pointing to some round gray glasses that Violet hadn’t even noticed.

Violet was sad, but there was no use arguing with her mother. She was stuck with the gray frames.

Still, Violet wasn’t about to put them on right away. She decided to pout, instead, all the way home.

The next day was a Saturday. It was raining hard, and Violet wouldn’t have gone outside if her father weren’t coming to take her to the movies.

“You all ready, Bug?” her dad asked, when he came to pick her up. He always called her Bug. “Where are your glasses?” he asked, when he saw her squinting up at him.

“I got new ones,” said Violet. Worried that her father wouldn’t like them, she’d put them in her backpack and was going to wear them in the dark theater where she knew no one could see them.

“Well, where are they?” he said.

Violet, not wanting to cause a scene, reached into her bag and put the round gray frames onto her face. She didn’t like them and was hoping maybe she could convince her dad to buy her new ones.

On the way to the movie theater, she noticed something very strange while peering through her new glasses. Way in the distance, a small bird was smiling at her. Flapping its wings and smiling.

That can’t be right, she thought. Then she looked around and noticed that other birds were making faces as well. A pigeon in a tree almost a mile away looked as if it had smelled something strange; its beak was twisted to the side as if in disgust. Then, on the sidewalk near a park they were approaching, she could see a squirrel sneeze, rub its nose, then move its lips as if to say, “Excuse me!”

Immediately, she pulled the glasses off of her face, in shock.

“What’s wrong?” asked her father.

But Violet didn’t want to say what she had seen. Were animals supposed to be so animated? Were these magical glasses?

She didn’t know, but one thing was for sure: she’d never seen such things before in her life, and she wanted to see more.

Slowly, she put the glasses back on. They were almost at the movie theater, so she made sure to look at as many trees as possible in search of more squirrels, more birds, and more little creatures.

Pushing her face up against the car window to her right, she started to stare intently and noticed a man walking his dog. The man was walking slowly, playing with his cell phone while his white poodle was pulling hard on its leash. Violet started to focus on the poodle, and she could have sworn she saw the pet roll its eyes and shake its head.

“Hurry up!” she said loudly, as her car went by the man with the cell phone. “Your dog is getting bored!”

“Excuse me?” said her father. “Who are you yelling at?”

“Oh, nothing,” said Violet. Her new glasses were her little secret, for now. And she couldn’t wait to explore the world through a new set of eyes!

### The Hunt
Beeeep beeeep beeeep. Aidan’s alarm clock rang out with a deafening screech. It was 9 a.m. and much too early for Aidan to be awake on a Saturday. As he lazily sat up and reached for the clock to turn it off, he realized what day it was. His birthday! He rubbed his eyes and stumbled out of bed. The smell of blueberry pancakes hit him as he clambered downstairs, which finally woke him up.

“Happy birthday, Aidan!” his parents excitedly greeted him as he sat down at the kitchen table. His mom turned around to grab a steaming plate of golden pancakes from the counter and set it in front of him. “Hold on, they aren’t finished just yet,” she told him. He thought she was going to get syrup, but she came back holding a bunch of striped candles.

“Candles in pancakes?” he thought as she pushed 13 candles into the top pancake and lit them with a match. Before his parents could say anything else, he quickly made a wish and blew out all the candles—he didn’t want the wax to melt into his delicious breakfast.

“Thank you!” he said with his mouth full. His mom and dad laughed as they watched him scarf down the heap of pancakes.

“Well, even though you have plenty planned for tomorrow, I have a surprise for you today,” his dad said. They had planned his party for Sunday, since that was when his older sister was able to come back home from university. “Go get dressed. Your surprise will be waiting for you downstairs when you get back,” he told his son.

Aidan rushed upstairs and returned back in five short minutes, with his pant leg still tucked into his sock and a tiny bit of toothpaste at the corner of his mouth.

His mother laughed. “Well, aren’t you excited,” she said with a smile.

On the kitchen table, Aidan noticed a piece of paper neatly folded into a small square. His dad noticed his gaze. “All right, well, open it up,” he told him. Aidan picked it up and unfolded it. On it, his dad had written a short note. He read it out loud. “Just like your favorite literary wizard, this spot is marked by a scar.”

“You made me a treasure hunt? !” Aidan asked excitedly. His dad nodded, smiling. He knew Aidan would love it; he was always watching crime movies and reading mystery novels.

Aidan started to think. His favorite literary wizard… that would have to be a character in one of his favorite books: Harry Potter. “Obviously,” he thought. He fell in love with the series as soon as he started the first book just a couple of years ago. He always secretly identified with the odd boy out who discovered he was a wizard at the young age of 11.

After some thinking, he finally remembered the small lightning mark he had carved into a tree in his backyard after finishing the seventh book in the series—the last one. He ran through the fallen red, orange, and brown leaves—Aidan’s favorite thing about fall. There it was: the scar in the clue. He searched around the tree’s base, looking for another piece of paper. He brushed away the leaves and finally found one tucked between two small rocks. He briskly opened it.

“Green is this poet’s color of choice; red is the color of his language; add some white and blue, and you have his flag. Oh, and your mom’s a fan.”

“This is a tough one,” thought Aidan. He knew he was searching for a poet. He didn’t know what green meant, so he started with red. He thought, “Well, red usually signifies love or anger, but a love poet makes more sense. So red, white, and blue are the colors of his or her flag. America?” He tried to think of some American love poets his mom liked, but he remembered none. After a few minutes, Aidan finally thought of the book on his mother’s nightstand: Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair by Pablo Neruda. “And he’s from Chile, so red, white, and blue!”

Aidan ran through the back door and up to his parents’ room to find the next clue. He then remembered his mom once mentioned that Neruda used to write with green ink. “Perfect,” he thought. The book was right on her nightstand. He opened it, and out fell another piece of paper.

“You’re almost there!” his dad called out from downstairs. Aidan peeled open the clue. “For this last clue, remember when your sister was blue and couldn’t find her favorite Boo.” Aidan started to think about the last part, “her favorite Boo.” He thought, “Boo had to be a name, since it was capitalized. Could it be the name of a toy when she was little? No, Melanie only got upset when she lost a book.” He thought for a while longer. “That’s it!” He remembered the time when Melanie lost To Kill a Mockingbird, her favorite book, in which Boo Radley, a mysterious neighbor, rescues the main character from a dangerous fight. She always talked about how the book was an American classic, and Harper Lee, the author, was her idol.

He ran outside to the end of his driveway, which is where the book fell out of her backpack one day on her way home from school. He crouched down and looked around for another piece of paper, but there wasn’t one to be found. Aidan was stumped. At last, he looked up, and out of the corner of his eye, he noticed someone watching him from across the street. He stood up and realized it was his sister.

“Surprise!” she yelled with a huge smile on her face.

### History of Halloween
Makayla gently placed her black witch’s hat on top of her black curls as she looked at herself in the mirror. Her mom had painted her skin green and outlined her eyes in purple paint. She wore tall, black boots underneath a long, purple dress. It was October 31st, and she was ready for trick-or-treating on Halloween night.

“Makayyyla!” her mom called out from downstairs.

Makayla’s two friends, Colden and Porter, had arrived. Colden stood in the doorway, his costume blowing in the wind. A white sheet hung over his head, and his eyes peered out from two cut-out holes.

Porter decided to dress like his favorite superhero, Batman. A black mask covered his face and a long cape trailed behind him. They carried plastic pumpkin bowls to collect candy later in the evening.

The two boys greeted Makayla with equal levels of excitement. “Hi, Makayla!” Colden said.

“You ready to go trick-or-treating?” Porter asked.

She nodded her head and ran to grab her coat.

“Let’s go, everyone!” her mom called out, and they all marched out the front door.

All around them, children and parents walked from door to door in colorful costumes. Carved Jack-o-lanterns sat in front of houses, candles shimmering inside the orange pumpkins. A breeze blew past Makayla and her friends, making her shiver. The weather had just started to get colder.

Makayla remembered her class earlier that day, when her teacher talked about the origins of Halloween. Mrs. Narula told Makayla and her classmates that the holiday started with an ancient festival called Samhain, 2,000 years ago in Ireland. The word Samhain means “summer’s end” in Gaelic, a language spoken in Ireland and Scotland. Mrs. Narula looked at different documents from the American Folklife Center to find out about Halloween’s history. She found that the festival celebrated the end of summer and the beginning of winter—a time to gather crops to prepare for the colder months.

The Celtic people who celebrated this festival also believed it was the time when all the souls who had died that year traveled to the next world. To keep the dead spirits away, people lit bonfires. For ceremonies, some dressed in animal furs to disguise themselves so that the dead spirits would not be able to recognize them. Mrs. Narula said this is one reason why we might still dress up in costumes today. Later, the festival of Samhain was replaced with All Souls’ Day, a Christian holiday that honored the dead. People celebrated with bonfires and parades. They also dressed up in costumes as saints, angels, and devils.

Porter reached up and pressed the doorbell at the house across the street.

Diiiing-dong.

A big, green Frankenstein pulled open the door, holding a big bowl of wrapped treats. Makayla and her friends gasped, and then laughed when they realized it was just Mr. Clock dressed up.

“Trick-or-treat!” the three sang with big smiles.

As Mr. Clock sprinkled candy into their baskets, Makayla thought of Mrs. Narula again.

“In the 1800s, many people from Ireland and Scotland came to the United States to start a new life,” the teacher told her students earlier that day. “Even though their ancestors had their own trick-or-treating traditions, they started their own in their new country.”

Mrs. Narula had read an article by Benjamin Radford, a man who researches science and history. He wrote that teenagers in those communities started to play pranks during Halloween celebrations. Adults tried to stop the pranks by giving children candy instead. And the tradition still remains today with children all around the world dressing up for candy!

### The Film Editor
When deciding whether a movie is good or not, most people think about the storyline. They think about the quality of the acting. Some might even remark on how well the movie was directed. Almost no one says: “Boy, that movie was really well edited!”

This is a dilemma that every film editor faces. Their work, while crucial to the success of a film, is rarely celebrated. Many don’t even know that the job title “Film Editor” exists. People win Academy Awards for Best Actor and Best Director. No one seems to care about the Best Editor.

“Everyone knows that Meryl Streep has won three Academy Awards for acting,” says Marc Rodriguez, a professional film editor based in New York City. “No one knows that Michael Kahn has won three Academy Awards for film editing.”

Rodriguez graduated from film school at New York University in Manhattan. As a teenager, he was always shooting footage of his friends on his family’s video camera. He worshipped legendary directors like Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg. Someday, he thought, I will make films of my own.

So after graduating from film school, Rodriguez took a job as an editor of television commercials. The idea was to make some money to afford making a feature-length film. But as he got more involved in editing, he fell in love with it. At 37 years old, he still hopes to direct a film. But film editing has become both his passion and his full-time job.

Speaking over the phone from his office in Brooklyn, Rodriguez explained what exactly a film editor does.

“I don’t want to take too much credit,” says Rodriguez, a stocky guy with floppy red hair, “but we essentially bring the film to life. For a big feature film, a director will often shoot over 100 hours of footage. Documentary filmmakers tend to shoot even more hours, because they don't know what the story is when they start. As the editor, it is my job to cut all that footage down to an hour and a half.”

“As you can imagine,” Rodriguez adds, “this requires a lot of time and patience.”

Luckily, Rodriguez is a patient man. Directors tend to have less patience. Their job involves gathering footage and making sure the actors get along. But after the film shoot is over, the director’s job is pretty much done; he or she hands over the footage to the editor. The editor is then tasked with taking out everything that doesn’t fit in the story.

Rodriguez works alone in a small, quiet office. His job requires intense amounts of concentration. On his desk, he keeps two computer monitors. One allows him to check the Internet and answer emails. The other is for editing films.

A typical day involves editing a 20 to 30 second scene of a movie. That's right: an entire day spent going over the same 20 or 30 seconds of a movie. In the end, this is how movies get made. As the editor, Rodriguez matches the sound with what is happening on-screen. He makes sure the storyline flows from scene to scene. He ensures that the stars of the film appear in as flattering a light as possible.

“For me, editing is like putting together a giant puzzle in which most of the pieces don’t fit,” he says with a laugh. “You look closely at all the footage. You examine it to see whether it should go into the final cut, as we call it. In the end, though, only a tiny percentage of the original footage makes it into the actual film.”

Now and then, Rodriguez says, he decides that he does not have enough footage to make a film. In such cases, the director is forced to film new scenes. This can be stressful for everyone involved. The actors may already be acting in other films or TV shows. The camera operator—the person who holds the camera—may have moved on as well. And yet the director must get everyone back together to shoot the final scenes. Otherwise the movie may never be completed.

“You really don’t want to tell directors that they have to shoot more footage,” Rodriguez says. “It’s something they really do not want to hear. Hopefully they understand it’s for the sake of the film. After all, no one wants to get a bad review! If it comes down to shooting more footage or getting ripped apart by movie critics, most directors will gladly shoot more scenes.”

Speaking of bad reviews, critics almost never mention the film’s editor in their reviews. To the press, the director and the writer are responsible if a film fails. The editor is left blameless. Of course, when a film is praised and wins awards, the editor does not receive much credit either.

Rodriguez understands that his profession will remain underappreciated. But he does make a good living. And he enjoys the challenge of putting a movie together. Seeing the final product on screen can be a thrilling experience. Then again, seeing all his intricate editing work projected onto a giant movie screen before a crowd full of people can come as a shock, too.

“You always see a thousand little mistakes,” he says. “But of course, the audience never notices, since they didn’t put the thing together. And even if they did notice the mistakes, they probably wouldn’t blame me. As I always say, no one blames the editor!”
