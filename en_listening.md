### The Magic Glasses
<p>Violet had always worn glasses. She’d had them for as long as she could remember. She was ten years old. So maybe she’d been wearing glasses for ten years. Maybe she was born with glasses!</p>

<p>Violet couldn’t see things that were far away from her. She also had trouble reading words that were close to her. Her eyesight was very poor.</p>

<p>Sometimes, while she was doing her homework in study hall, her glasses would fall down to the tip of her nose. One day, they fell off her face and landed on the floor.</p>

<p>Violet had to crawl on the floor and feel around with her hands to look for her glasses. Her teacher saw her doing this. “Violet, what’s going on?” her teacher asked.</p>

<p>“I can’t find my glasses,” said Violet, shyly. The rest of the students looked up from their books. They started to laugh.</p>

<p>Finally, Violet found the brown glasses behind her desk. She quickly put them back onto her face. But they wouldn’t stay on. They were broken.</p>

<p>She knew that if she said anything about her broken glasses, people would keep looking at her. She didn’t want that. So she just held her glasses on her face with her finger and pretended to read.</p>

<p>That night at home, she told her mother that her glasses broke.</p>

<p>Violet’s mother was a doctor and she worked a lot every day. When she came home, she was often too tired to do much, other than watch television with Violet. Violet’s father didn’t live with them, but Violet visited him on weekends. He lived in a nearby town and always took her to baseball games in the summer.</p>

<p>But it wasn’t summer yet. Violet still had three months left of school. And that meant she had three more months of being made fun of because of her silly glasses.</p>

<p>Violet hated her glasses.</p>

<p>When she told her mother what had happened, her mother said, “We’re going to have to get you new glasses.”</p>

<p>The day after her glasses broke, Violet’s mother took her to the eye doctor. They did all sorts of tests to see whether she needed a new prescription. A prescription for glasses measures how well a person can see. The tests showed that her eyes had gotten worse since the last time she’d been there. So the doctor gave her a prescription for stronger glasses. After that, it was time to pick out new glasses.</p>

<p>Violet looked into the shiny case that held all the glasses. There were boring, brown glasses and simple, black glasses. But there were also some pink and blue glasses. There were even some sparkly yellow ones.</p>

<p>“Mom, can I get those?” Violet said, pointing to the sparkly yellow glasses.</p>

<p>“No, you cannot. You can’t wear something like that to school,” said her mother.</p>

<p>“But…” said Violet.</p>

<p>“No ‘buts.’ You will get these ones right here,” said her mother. She pointed to some round, gray glasses that Violet hadn’t even seen.</p>

<p>Violet was sad that she couldn’t get fun glasses. But there was no use in fighting with her mother. She was stuck with the gray glasses.</p>

<p>Still, Violet didn’t want to put them on right away. Instead, she decided to frown all the way home.</p>

<p>The next day was a Saturday. It was raining hard. Violet’s father was coming to take her to see a movie.</p>

<p>“You all ready, Bug?” her dad asked when he picked her up. He always called her Bug. “Where are your glasses?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I got new ones,” said Violet. She was worried that her father wouldn’t like her new glasses. So she had put them in her backpack. She was going to wear them in the dark movie theater, where she knew no one could see them.</p>

<p>“Well, where are they?” he said.</p>

<p>Violet did not want to make any trouble or cause a scene. So she reached into her bag and put on the round gray glasses. She did not like them, and hoped that she could get her dad to buy her new glasses.</p>

<p>On the way to the movie theater, she saw something very strange while looking through her new glasses. Far away, a small bird was smiling at her. It was flapping its wings and smiling.</p>

<p><em>That can’t be right</em>, she thought. Then she looked around. There were other birds making faces as well. A pigeon in a faraway tree looked as if he had smelled something gross. His face was all twisted up. Violet and her dad drove past the park. She saw a squirrel sneeze and rub his nose. Then it moved its lips as if to say, “Excuse me!”</p>

<p>She quickly pulled the glasses off of her face. She couldn’t believe what she had seen.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?” asked her father.</p>

<p>Violet didn’t want to say what she had seen. Those animals were acting like people! Were animals supposed to be so lively and animated? Were these magical glasses?</p>

<p>She didn’t know. But one thing was for sure: she’d never seen such things before in her life. And she wanted to see more.</p>

<p>Slowly, she put the glasses back on. She was almost at the movie theater. She wanted to see as many squirrels, birds, and other little animals as she could before she got there.  </p>

<p>She pushed her face up against the car window and stared outside. She saw a man walking his dog. The man was walking slowly. He was playing with his cell phone, and his white poodle was pulling hard on its leash. Violet looked at the dog. She was sure she saw it roll its eyes and shake its head.</p>

<p>“Hurry up!” she shouted at the man. “Your dog is getting bored!”</p>

<p>“Excuse me?” said her father. “Who are you yelling at?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no one,” said Violet. Her new glasses were her little secret, for now. And she couldn’t wait to look at the world through a new set of eyes!</p>
