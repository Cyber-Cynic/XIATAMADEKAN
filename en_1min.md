### Accident
I wonder how many accidents <blank>I’ve had</blank> in my life. I’ve had a few serious ones where I’ve ended up in hospital. Traffic accidents are the worst. They’re always painful. I haven’t had too many <blank>work-related</blank> accidents. I suppose that’s because I do office work and that’s not so dangerous. Most of my accidents are those around the house. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve hit <blank>my thumb</blank> with a hammer. I’m also really good at standing up and hitting my head on something. I’m not as bad as my friend though. He’s a real accident looking for somewhere to happen. Almost every time we meet, he has some story to tell about his latest accident. He’s quite <blank>unbelievable</blank>. I think I’d be very worried if I were his mother.

### Actors
Being an actor must be great. I really wish I could act. I’d love to have the confidence to act <blank>in front of</blank> people. Being a member of the <blank>audience</blank> at the theatre is great, but acting on stage is better. I wonder what it’s like to be a movie star. I think you need to be beautiful or handsome to be a successful Hollywood or Bollywood actor. They all look great. Actors are very lucky. They get paid <blank>huge amounts</blank> of money to do what they love doing. My favourite actors are <blank>all dead</blank> now. I really like the actors in the <blank>old black</blank> and white movies. They all looked so cool. Actors in the old days seemed to be more <blank>glamorous</blank> than today’s actors. The best thing about being an actor is that all of your friends are <blank>famous</blank> too.

### Advertising
What is advertising? Is it telling the truth or is it making things look better than they really are? Or is it lying? Companies pay a lot of money for adverts. Some of the ads you see in <blank>glossy</blank> magazines look like art. The commercials on TV look like mini movies. Do they really change our <blank>behaviour</blank>? Do adverts make you buy things? I think some advertising is a form of lying. Is BMW really “The <blank>ultimate</blank> driving machine” like they say in their ads? British Airways used to say they were “The world’s favourite airline,” but had to stop saying it because it wasn’t true. Personally, I get tired of watching ads on television. They always <blank>interrupt</blank> a good programme. I like ads in magazines. They’re usually quite interesting.

### Advice
I don’t know what I would do without my friends’ advice. They’ve all given me so much good advice over the years. It’s sometimes very difficult to make <blank>decisions</blank> on your own. Listening to advice can be great for helping you make the right decision. The greatest piece of advice I’ve received was from my father. He told me I can do anything in life if I <blank>try hard</blank>. He was right. I am now <blank>passing</blank> on his advice to my own children. Right now I need some advice on money. My <blank>financial</blank> advisors are telling me to be very careful. That’s very sound advice. I would advise anyone to do the same. Someone asked me the other day about the worst piece of advice I’ve ever had. I couldn’t answer. I don’t think I’ve had any really bad advice.
