### Accident
I wonder how many accidents <blank>I’ve had</blank> in my life. I’ve had a few serious ones where I’ve ended up in hospital. Traffic accidents are the worst. They’re always painful. I haven’t had too many <blank>work-related</blank> accidents. I suppose that’s because I do office work and that’s not so dangerous. Most of my accidents are those around the house. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve hit <blank>my thumb</blank> with a hammer. I’m also really good at standing up and hitting my head on something. I’m not as bad as my friend though. He’s a real accident looking for somewhere to happen. Almost every time we meet, he has some story to tell about his latest accident. He’s quite <blank>unbelievable</blank>. I think I’d be very worried if I were his mother.

### Actors

Being an actor must be great. I really wish I could act. I’d love to have the confidence to act <blank>in front of</blank> people. Being a member of the <blank>audience</blank> at the theatre is great, but acting on stage is better. I wonder what it’s like to be a movie star. I think you need to be beautiful or handsome to be a successful Hollywood or Bollywood actor. They all look great. Actors are very lucky. They get paid <blank>huge amounts</blank> of money to do what they love doing. My favourite actors are <blank>all dead</blank> now. I really like the actors in the <blank>old black</blank> and white movies. They all looked so cool. Actors in the old days seemed to be more <blank>glamorous</blank> than today’s actors. The best thing about being an actor is that all of your friends are <blank>famous</blank> too.
